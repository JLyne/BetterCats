# BetterCats

Bukkit plugin to make Minecraft cats better.

# What does it do?

Currently, it just makes cat make noises (usually purring sounds or meowing) when right-clicked, the closest thing I could come up with when someone asked if they could pet a Minecraft cat.

Disclaimer: I do not expect a single living being other than myself to install this plugin. It's public only so that I can get to the releases section without logging in. That doesn't mean you can't, but don't expect any code I put here to be very good.
