# BetterCats

Bukkit plugin to make Minecraft cats better.

# What does it do?

This plugin presently does two things:

1. Cats make noises when you right-click them. Being the original purpose for this plugin, this is all I could come up with when someone asked me "How do I pet cats?"
2. Cats play with string left as items on the ground.


Disclaimer: I do not expect a single living being other than myself to install this plugin. It's public only so that I can get to the releases section without logging in. That doesn't mean you can't, but don't expect any code I put here to be very good.
